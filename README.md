This repository contains solutions for the Database Systems assignment, divided into three questions.

# Question 1:  Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram
In this question, an ER diagram was drawn based on the given specifications. The entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints were identified following the outlined requirements. Various assumptions were made to complete the diagram accurately.

# Question 2: ER Diagram Mapping to Relational Database Schema
This question involved creating an ER diagram that can be mapped to a given relational database schema. The ER diagram was designed to correspond to the provided schema and demonstrate the relationships between entities.

# Question 3: System Requirements and Constraints
In this question, we analyzed an existing ER diagram considering specific system requirements and constraints. The (min, max) constraints were provided based on the given assumptions, and conditions for redundancy in the relationship were discussed.

For detailed diagrams, constraints, and additional information, refer to the respective directories for each question.
